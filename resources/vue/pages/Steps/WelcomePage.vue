                    Welcome to Praella! We give Shopify stores the mechanisms to thrive. This app is the only connector that bridges Avalara with Shopify and supports brands set up automated Excise Tax compliance.
                    <br /><br />
                    <PHeading>How it works</PHeading><br />
                    The app closely works with Avalara to calculate Excise Tax for all the Shopify Plus transactions triggered by what your customers buy at the checkout.
